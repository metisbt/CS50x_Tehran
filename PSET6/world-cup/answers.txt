Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: In 2018m.csv i see some issues in results

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: after 5 time i call good enough
